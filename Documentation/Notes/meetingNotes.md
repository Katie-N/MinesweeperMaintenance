## Project Requirements

**Project 1 Functionality**
- Game setup, gameplay, mine flagging, player interface, and game conclusion must all work, even if inherited code was buggy.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) Solver**
- AI plays on the same board as the player.
- Turns alternate between player and AI (interactive mode) or AI solves automatically.
    - Easy: AI uncovers random cells, avoids flagged/uncovered.
    - Medium: AI uncovers randomly until a safe cell (zero adjacent mines), then uses revealed numbers to uncover adjacent cells.
    - Hard: AI always uncovers a safe cell (never detonates a mine; simulates perfect knowledge).

**Custom Addition**
- Propose and implement one new feature to enhance the game.
- Describe the feature with a UML diagram (class, sequence, or use case).
