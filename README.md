# Minesweeper

## Description
Minesweeper, a single-player puzzle game. Players interact with a 10x10 grid, uncovering cells to reveal numbers indicating adjacent mines while avoiding detonation. Players can flag suspected mine locations.

Play Minesweeper with a fully interactive user interface. Choose between 10-20 mines on a 10x10 board.

Once the game has started, left click to reveal a square, right click to flag a square.

Game is over when either a mine is revealed or all non-mines are revealed. Flags have no impact on victory conditions and are only for visual aid, and do not need to be placed to win.
