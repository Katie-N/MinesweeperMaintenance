# Minesweeper

## Description

Play Minesweeper with a fully interactive user interface. Choose between 10-20 mines on a 10x10 board.

Once the game has started, left click to reveal a square, right click to flag a square.

Game is over when either a mine is revealed or all non-mines are revealed. Flags have no impact on victory conditions and are only for visual aid, and do not need to be placed to win.

## Requirements

* Python 3 and pip
* Pygame (see Installation instructions)
* Pygame TextInput (see Installation instructions)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3 and pip

### Installation

Fork the repository into a folder of your choice and navigate there.

Create a new environment with a Python 3.x.x interpreter.

Run the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame pygame-textinput
```

## Usage

From the base folder, run the following command:

```bash
python3 Minesweeper/PlayMinesweeper.py
```

This will generate a Pygame window which can be interacted with. To start, type a number between 10-20 and hit enter, starting the Minesweeper game. After that, left and right click to play.
